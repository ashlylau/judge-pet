# Judge Pet
50% of time taken to judge gymnstics is actually spent doing mental sums, which is 1) tiring. 2) error prone. This app fixes that. 

Written in Swift to make use of the Scribble API for handwriting recognition.


### MVP

- number of valued elements
- number of Compositional Requirements
- total connection bonus
